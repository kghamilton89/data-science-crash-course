## Course Introduction and Goals

Welcome to my Data Science Crash Course. The goal of this course is to help aspiring data scientists, analysts, and others who are adjacent to code-writing spaces, but may not actually have a code-writing background themselves.

This course will cover all of the aspects of working with, interrogating, and analyzing large datasets using the Python language and some of its more ubiquitous libraries.

My assumption is that you have some background in data science and analytics concepts and are probably using AI tools like ChatGPT to help you write Jupyter Notebooks, but aspire to have a deeper understanding of what is actually happening at the code level and / or render yourself less reliant on AI systems.

## Prerequisites

Setting up your preferred IDE, installing a Python interpreter (and indeed, understanding what a Python interpreter is), as well as the kind of big picture stuff around "what is Jupyter Notebook?" and similar questions are all out of scope of this course. I'm going to make the assumption that you can open up something like VS Code, understand the basics about what is happening when we `pip install` something, and have a pretty strong understanding of basic data science concepts and techniques.

## Outcomes

This is a self-guided course whose expected outcomes are a deeper understanding of what your data science code is actually doing when you are working in Jupyter Notebook. After working with and studying this material, you ought to have a stronger understanding of how to modify your code on the fly and how to get to the results you want faster, with less time searching StackOverflow or asking ChatGPT.

## Contents

This course covers everything you need to learn the basics about the kind of work done by data analysts and data scientists, including:

- [Uploading and Inspecting Data](./uploading-and-inspecting-data/notebook.ipynb)
  - [Working with Pickled Data](./working-with-pickled-data/notebook.ipynb)
  - [Working with Dictionaries](./working-with-dictionaries/notebook.ipynb)
- [Basic Data Interrogation](./basic-data-interrogation/notebook.ipynb)
- [Statistical Analysis of Queries](./statistical-analysis-of-queries/noteboook.ipynb)
- [Bayes' Theorum](./bayes-theorum/notebook.ipynb)
- [Symantic Comparison and String Clustering](./symantic-comparison-and-string-clustering/notebook.ipynb)

Raise an issue or a Pull Request if you'd like to see a notebook on a particular subject!

## Sandbox

By the end of the course, you ought to be able to work your way through the entire [Sandbox](./sandbox/notebook.ipynb) notebook without using any external help like AI code generation or even documentation!

Once you've gotten that far, congratulations! You're ready to start looking into more advanced data science courses and techniques.
