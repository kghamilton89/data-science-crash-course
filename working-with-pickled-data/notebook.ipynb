    "# Working with Pickled Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Pickled (`.pkl`) data in Python refers to a serialized format used to store Python objects in a binary file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pickle module allows complex data structures—like lists, dictionaries, tuples, classes, and even functions—to be saved and later restored exactly as they were. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike formats like JSON or CSV, Pickle preserves Python-specific types and object hierarchies. It's ideal for saving machine learning models, session states, or any Python-native data so if you work in the data science field for long enough, you're bound to come across this data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note, Pickle files are not human-readable and should never be loaded from untrusted sources, as they can execute arbitrary code during deserialization.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I've included some `.pkl` datasets in the `./data` folder and will be using them for this tutorial, but I'm just a guy on the internet, so I'd wholeheartedly encourage you to generate some synthetic `.pkl` data of your own to work with for this workbook. It's just a good habit to be in."
